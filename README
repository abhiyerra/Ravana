Tradings is a Torrent tracker which allows for fallback and redundancy.
This means that a tracker does not work in isolation, but in a distributed
manner. Whenever a new upload is created it is distributed to the swarm
of torrent trackers acting through Oauth.

"The death of one node is a tragedy, a death of a million a statistic."
